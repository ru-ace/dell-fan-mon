.TH dell-fan-mon 1 "05 Jab 2019" "ace" Utilities
.SH "NAME"
dell-fan-mon \- temperature monitor for Dell Laptops
.SH "DISCLAIMER"
This program calls undocumented functions of Dell SMM BIOS by defaults.
.br
\fBUSE ON YOUR OWN RISK\fP
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
dell-fan-mon [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The dell-fan-mon is a daemon that monitors cpu and gpu temperatures, and controls the fan speed on some Dell laptops. 
.br
It does that by means of regularly reading the system temperature, and choosing appropriate speed of the fans. 
.LP
All options can be customized at \fB/etc/dell-fan-mon.conf\fP, or via command-line options
.LP
On Debian and derivated OSes, dell-fan-mon starts in the background by default as a service.
.SH "ACCESS MODE"
dell-fan-mon can access for temp and fan control with two modes (\fB--mode\fR <\fImode\fP>):
.IP \[bu] 2
\fImode\fP 0: use dell-smm-hwmon(i8k) kernel module. This mode is more safety and can be used by unprivileged user.
.IP \[bu] 
\fImode\fP 1: use direct SMM BIOS calls. To use this mode, dell-fan-mon needs root privileges (default) 
.SH "DISABLE BIOS FAN CONTROL"
dell-fan-mon can try disable BIOS fan control with two methods(\fB--bios_disable_method\fR <\fImethod\fP>):
.IP \[bu] 2
\fImethod\fP 1: using code from \fIhttps://github.com/clopez/dellfan\fP
.IP \[bu]
\fImethod\fP 2: identical with \fIhttps://github.com/TomFreudenberg/dell-bios-fan-control\fP
.LP
To use this feature, dell-fan-mon needs root privileges.
.LP
Before set this option in config file, stop dell-fan-mon (sudo service dell-fan-mon stop) and try every method in verbose mode
(sudo dell-fan-mon -v --bios_disable_method 2 --fan_ctrl_logic_mode 0).
Wait until cpu temp will be greater \fBt_mid\fR and fans was on.
If during cpu temp lowering BIOS doesn't try change fan state: seems this method works.
.LP
On exit (SIGTERM, SIGINT) dell-fan-mon set fans speed to max and try to restore BIOS fan control with corresponding \fImethod\fP 
.LP
Use \fImethod\fP 0 for disable this feature. In \fImethod\fP 0 dell-fan-mon checks and controls fan state. 
.br
Check \fBfan_check_period\fR and \fBmonitor_fan_id\fR options.

.SH "LAPTOPS WITH DISCRETE GPU"
dell-fan-mon supports monitoring discrete GPU temp (\fB--discrete_gpu_mode\fR <\fImode\fP>) with 3 modes:
.IP \[bu] 2
\fImode\fP 0: monitor cpu_temp only (for integrated GPU) 
.IP \[bu]
\fImode\fP 1: use temp = max(cpu_temp, gpu_temp) in fan control logic (default)
.IP \[bu]
\fImode\fP 2: use separate fans control (for laptops with dedicated fan for discrete gpu)
.LP
dell-fan-mon supports two methods for obtaining GPU temp:
.IP \[bu] 2
Using direct SMM BIOS calls(\fB--mode 1\fR) dell-fan-mon try to autodetect GPU temp sensor.
If autodetection failed \fBdiscrete_gpu_mode\fR automatically switch to \fB0\fR (monitor cpu_temp only). 
If it happened for you: please use second method.
.IP \[bu]
Using third party console utility. Set \fBget_gpu_temp_cmd\fR options in config file.
In this case you need provide command which output one line with one number (GPU temp)

\fImode\fP 2 use \fBcpu_fan_id\fR and \fBgpu_fan_id\fR options, that also attempt to automatically detect using the SMM BIOS(\fB--mode 1\fR). 
You can switch back to \fB--mode 0\fR if you setting \fBget_gpu_temp_cmd\fR, \fBcpu_fan_id\fR amd \fBgpu_fan_id\fR manualy 
(you can find \fBcpu_fan_id\fR and \fBgpu_fan_id\fR values in verbose mode after successed autodetection)
.LP
If you have discrete GPU it's good idea to run dell-fan-mon in verbose mode to be sure that autodetection works fine.

.SH "FAN CONTROL LOGIC"
dell-fan-mon has two modes of fans control logic(\fB--fan_ctrl_logic_mode\fR <\fImode\fP>) regarding 3 temperature thresholds \fBt_low\fR, \fBt_mid\fR, \fBt_high\fR and corresponding fan states \fBt_low_fan\fR, \fBt_mid_fan\fR, \fBt_high_fan\fR:
.IP \[bu] 2
\fImode\fP 0: Default logic (with default t_*_fan)
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2 
When temperature rising:
    if temp in [t_low,t_mid] and fan_state = OFF: fan_state = OFF
    if temp > t_mid: fan_state = LOW
    if temp > t_high: fan_state = HIGH
.IP \[bu]
When temperature lowering:
    if temp < t_low: fan_state = OFF
    if temp in [t_low,t_mid] and fan_state = LOW: fan_state = LOW
    if temp in [t_low, t_high] and fan_state = HIGH: fan_state = HIGH

.IP \[bu]
Real code:
    if (temp <= cfg.t_low)
        fan_state = cfg.t_low_fan;
    else if (temp > cfg.t_high)
        fan_state = cfg.t_high_fan;
    else if (temp >= cfg.t_mid)
        fan_state = fan_state > cfg.t_mid_fan ? fan_state : cfg.t_mid_fan;
.RE

.IP \[bu]
\fImode\fP 1: Simple logic which allow BIOS to control fans. Stop/start fans оnly at boundary temps
    if temp < t_low: fan_state = t_low_fan
    if temp > t_high: fan_state = t_high_fan
.SH "ABNORMAL TEMP JUMP DETECTION"
dell-fan-mon has buildin mechanism for detect abnormal cpu temp jumps: short(1-2 seconds) cpu temp jumps on +20/+30 celsius which are cause of starting fans. You can control it via \fB--jump_temp_delta\fR and \fB--jump_timeout\fR options.
.LP
To disable this feature set \fBjump_temp_delta\fR to 100.
